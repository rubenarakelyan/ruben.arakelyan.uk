    <h1>About me</h1>
  </section>
  <section>
    <p>I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wimbledon,_London" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Wimbledon</a>, south London — home of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Championships,_Wimbledon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Championships</a> — and lived there for approximately 5 years before moving across the river to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastcote" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eastcote</a> where I lived, grew up and went to school (where my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040717231151/http://education.independent.co.uk/news/story.jsp?story=539986" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">year 11 ball</a> was featured in The Independent).</p>
    <p>At the end of 2003, I created my first website, wackomenace (named after I used one of the then-common ninja name generator websites), using a prepaid card (Splash Plastic) and a friendly web host that accepted it (Purple Cloud). It soon grew to include a blog, tools and resources as well as some of my first open-source code.</p>
    <p>I quickly got into the then popular “blog scene” featuring such luminaries as (in no particular order) <a href="https://a.wholelottanothing.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Matt Haughey</a>, <a href="https://anildash.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Anil Dash</a>, <a href="https://www.zeldman.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jeffrey Zeldman</a>, <a href="https://kottke.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jason Kottke</a>, <a href="https://meyerweb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eric Meyer</a>, Mark Pilgrim, <a href="https://about.me/cam" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cameron Barrett</a>, <a href="http://daveshea.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dave Shea</a>, <a href="https://simplebits.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dan Cederholm</a>, <a href="https://stopdesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Douglas Bowman</a> and <a href="https://waferbaby.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Daniel Bogan</a>, amongst others, taking design and development cues as the web quickly evolved. I was even one of the <a href="https://kottke.org/about/patron/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">kottke.org micropatrons</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2006, I went to university at the <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">University of Reading</a> where I got a degree in Computer Science. During that time, I worked for a year at the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mtc/locations?activetab=pivotregiongroup:primaryr5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Microsoft Technology Centre</a> in Reading.</p>
    <p>Around the end of 2008, wackomenace went offline as I migrated to more “respectable” domain names.</p>
    <p>My first job out of university was a Business Analyst at <a href="https://www.shell.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Royal Dutch Shell</a> on the graduate programme. I stayed with Shell for four-and-a-half years, working in a number of areas and it’s also where I met <a href="https://joannaandruben.uk/" target="_blank">my future wife</a>.</p>
    <p>After this time, I decided that I wanted to get back into hands-on development and so left the comfort of a multinational company to move to <a href="https://www.orderswift.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">orderswift</a>, a small startup working in online food ordering. It was a change of industry and a massive change of pace and responsibility, doing everything from web development to hardware installation and customer service. I stayed for a year, but probably learnt about five years worth in the time!</p>
    <p>I was looking for something a little different at this point, and happened to come across the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Government Digital Service</a>. I liked the organisation, their work and their ways of working, so when the opportunity arose, I said yes with little hesitation. I spent three years working on various parts of GOV.UK, and in that time moved up to eventually become Lead Developer. I also, for the first time, carried out and led interview and became a line manager. I had an <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2018/08/03/how-we-use-instagram-at-gds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Instagram story</a> made about my work and blogged about <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2017/07/24/what-do-we-mean-by-responsible-building/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">the meaning of responsible building</a>. The work gave me a real sense of purpose and I loved every moment of it.</p>
    <p>In 2019, having decided to move from London to Cornwall with my wife, and remote working still being something that wasn’t universally accepted, I left GDS and London, and started work at <a href="https://www.resolvergroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resolver</a> mostly remote but with three days a month in the office in London. I used to travel by train or plane and stay with my parents, but COVID put an end to this commute and for the time being I am fully remote.</p>
    <p>My current job is a Senior Backend Developer at <a href="https://hopin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hopin</a>.</p>
