    <p>For posterity, I have archived a <a href="/archive/resolverblog/">copy of all my blog posts</a> from the <a href="https://engineering.resolvergroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Resolver Engineering blog</a>.</p>
    <p>Theyâ€™re mostly related to AWS and Terraform and will hopefully be of use to someone.</p>
