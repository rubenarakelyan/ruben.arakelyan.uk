    <h1>Hi, I’m Ruben</h1>
    <h2>I’m a web developer in Cornwall, UK, and my wife can <a href="https://www.relocatetocornwall.co.uk/" target="_blank">help you move here</a>.</h2>

    <p>I’m currently a Senior Backend Developer at <a href="https://hopin.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hopin</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rubenarakelyan" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> has more details of my work history, and <a href="https://github.com/rubenarakelyan" target="_blank">GitHub</a> has all my code.</p>
    <p>I’m a web developer by trade but also like to tinker in other areas like home automation.</p>
    <p>I’ve been spending too much time with computers for as long as I can remember. From my first PC, bought for £10 from a charity shop, all the way through multiple Macs and custom-built PCs, they have been both my day job and my main hobby.</p>
    <p>If you’re interested, you can also read <a href="/about/">more about me</a>.</p>

    <h2>About this site</h2>
    <p>This is the umpteenth iteration of my personal website. I’ve moved a number of times between hosting providers, technology stacks and having a blog versus a very plain, low-maintenance landing page. You can find older iterations for my previous websites at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ruben.arakelyan.uk/*" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ruben.arakelyan.uk</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ruben.am/*" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ruben.am</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://ra.me.uk/*" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ra.me.uk</a> at the Internet Archive. In addition, most old URLs should still work because <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cool URIs don’t change</a>.</p>
    <p>I’ve deliberately decided to use the latest technologies and not spend time trying to work around browsers that don’t support them. If it looks a bit wonky to you and you’re not using a browser that fully supports current web standards, then unfortunately you’re on your own.</p>
    <p>The current version of the site is generated as a static site by <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eleventy</a>, stored on <a href="https://github.com/rubenarakelyan/ruben.arakelyan.uk" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and hosted on Netlify. This means I don’t have to worry about bandwidth, databases, or security patches.</p>

    <h2>Get in touch</h2>
    <p>I’m always interested to hear from people about this website, my work, my code or interesting projects. I am not interested in propositions for investment, hiring or mass emails.</p>
    <p>You can email me by replacing the first <code>.</code> in this domain name with an <code>@</code>.</p>
